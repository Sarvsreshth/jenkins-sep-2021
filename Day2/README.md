# Maven

### Overview
 - is a build tool used pre-dominently by Java projects
 - prior to this Apache Ant was the tool used mostly
 - it is an opensource tool from Apache
 - Convention over Configuration
      - 80 - 20 Principle

### Installing JDK in CentOS 
```
sudo yum install -y epel-release
sudo yum install java-11-openjdk-devel
```
Test if javac and java works as expected
```
java -version
javac -version
```

### Setting up Maven
```
wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.8.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.8.2-bin.tar.gz
tar xvfz apache-maven-3.8.2-bin.tar.gz
```

#### Set up environments path to access Maven from any directory
You need to edit ~/.bashrc and append the below lines
```
# User specific aliases and functions
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.12.0.7-0.el8_4.x86_64
export M2_HOME=/home/rps/Downloads/apache-maven-3.8.2
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME/bin:$PATH
```
To apply the exports on the current terminal session
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
Try maven version
```
mvn --version
```
The expected output is
<pre>
[jegan@localhost ~]$ mvn --version

### Cloning TekTutor training repository
You need to clone if you haven't done it already.  This is done only the first time, moving forward whenever I push code changes to this repository, you just need to pull to get the delta changes.
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/tektutor/jenkins-sep-2021.git
```

### Compiling Hello Java application
```
cd ~/jenkins-sep-2021
git pull
cd Day2/Hello
mvn compile
```
Maven compiles includes the below Maven phases
1. mvn compile --> this compiles all the sources kept at src/main/java and its sub-folders

### Compiling Hello Java application and running unit test cases as part of the build
```
cd ~/jenkins-sep-2021
git pull
cd Day2/Hello
mvn test
```
Maven test includes the below major Maven phases
1. mvn compile --> this compiles all source kept at src/main/java and its subfolders
2. mvn testCompile --> this compiles all source kept at src/test/java and its subfolders
3. mvn test --> this execute the compiled test case

### Just in case, you are curious to list all default maven life-cycle phases
```
cd ~/jenkins-sep-2021
git pull
cd Day2/Hello
mvn help:describe -Dcmd=compile
```
